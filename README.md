# brain_tumor_detection_using_CNNs

This repository contains codes and datasets for a machine learning project that can preidct and determine brain tumors by identifying scanned MRIs using CNNs. The algorithm can identify brains with and without tumor by reading the scanned MRIs. The data set is from Kaggle's brain tumor dataset. 
This is a Binary Image Classsification project made by use of CNNs, the project classifies scanned images of brain to Healthy and Unhealthy brains.
The final model is used to create a flask webapp that detects brain tumor MRI scans
The vscode files for the web app is also attached with this repository.
